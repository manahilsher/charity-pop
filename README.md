# Charity Pop V2

Version 1: https://youtu.be/4GXt1CegvGg

Version 2: In progress (this is the repo). Using AWS instead of Firebase, including Amplify, Cognito, DynamoDB, and Lambda functions. V1 was based on one team and one campaign without any users - V2 will have the ability to create different accounts, campaigns, and teams.
